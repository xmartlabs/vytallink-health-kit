# Skill: generate_e2e_tests

## Purpose

Generate end-to-end tests that validate critical user or API flows.

## Required Input

- Target flow description.
- Entry point (API/CLI/service).
- Fixtures or test data assumptions.
- Success and failure criteria.

## Output Format

- Test file path under `tests/`.
- Scenario list (happy path + key edge paths).
- Execution command (`make test` or scoped pytest command).

## Execution Rules

1. Keep tests deterministic and isolated.
2. Avoid coupling tests to notebook artifacts.
3. Use clear test naming and English docstrings/comments.
